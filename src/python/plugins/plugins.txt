Provides several html widgets (both server-side and client-side, in js / php / python)
to be used as a (single) plugin in Contemplate Engine, if needed, instead of duplicating/developing extra plugins here.

All projects of mine which were using Contemplate plugins, have been updated to use HtmlWidget as a single plugin,
with additonal parameters to output any widget supported, in a modular way.
